`This repository is meant to be empty. You currently have a working frontend and backend in two different repositories.`

For this assignment, you would keep them the way they are (separated), meaning you would run them separately and have them talk to each other.

This repository is to open a PR and leave a comment to share the links of your frontend and backend PRs that you already have (from previous assignments).
If you don't have a backend PR then you should create one from your own backend copy (the one you forked from your team lead).

If you didn't fork from your team lead backend repo. you should fork from your team lead backend repo and open a PR here (Integrify's repository).

`PS: OPEN A PR FROM DAY ONE`
